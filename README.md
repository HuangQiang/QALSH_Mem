# QALSH_Mem: Memory Version of QALSH and QALSH+

Version: 1.3.1

Release date: 03-10-2017

Last Modified: 20-04-2018


Introduction
--------

This package is written in the C++ programming language. It provides two 
internal LSH schemes (QALSH and QALSH+) for c-Approximate Nearest Neighbor 
(or simply c-ANN) search under l_p norm, where p \in (0, 2].


How to use this Package?
--------

We provide a Makefile and a script (i.e., run_mnist.sh) as a running example 
for comipling and running this package. Before start running this package, 
please ensure the input format of the dataset and query set is correct. We 
provide a sample dataset and query set (i.e., Mnist) for your reference.

We also provide the scripts (i.e., run_sift.sh, run_gist.sh, run_trevi.sh, 
and run_p53.sh) for the users who would like to reproduce our results presented 
in PVLDB 2015 and VLDBJ 2017. The datasets Sift, Gist, Trevi, and P53 we used 
can be downloaded from the following links:
